# ðŸ’¼ Coding Quiz Notes

Welcome! Hereâ€™s a list of all coding quizzes Iâ€™ve written up, organized by company and position:

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% assign parts = post.title | split: "-" %}
    {% assign company = parts[0] | strip %}
    {% assign position = parts[1] | strip %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">
        {{ company }} â€“ {{ position | default: "Unknown Role" }} ({{ post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }})
      </a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
